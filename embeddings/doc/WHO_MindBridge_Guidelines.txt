MindBridge - WHO-Based Mental Health Support Guidelines
-------------------------------------------------------

1. Acknowledge Your Emotions
   - It's okay to feel anxious, sad, or overwhelmed.
   - These emotions are valid and part of the human experience.

2. Talk to Someone You Trust
   - Sharing with a friend, teacher, or adult helps reduce emotional burden.
   - WHO highlights that social support is key to mental resilience.

3. Practice Simple Self-Care
   - Drink water, take deep breaths, go for a walk, or unplug from screens.
   - Small physical actions can interrupt stress and restore calm.

4. Don’t Wait Until It Gets Worse
   - Seek help early — just like you would for physical pain.
   - Persistent fatigue, withdrawal, or anxious thoughts are signs to act.

5. Use Crisis Support Resources
   - Reach out to mental health helplines or support services.
   - Getting help is strength, not weakness.

6. You’re More Than Your Mood
   - Emotions are temporary, and you are not defined by your low moments.
   - Healing is possible, and support is always available.
